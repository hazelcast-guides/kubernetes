= Hazelcast for Kubernetes

This sample is a guideline on how to start and use Hazelcast cluster in Kubernetes.

include::{templates-url}/link-to-repo.adoc[]

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide, you will deploy Hazelcast cluster to Kubernetes and connect to it using Hazelcast client.

== Prerequisites

* Up and running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster (version 1.9 or higher)
* Kubernetes command line tool, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl]
* (optional) https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm CLI]

== Deploy Hazelcast cluster

There are different ways of deploying Hazelcast to Kubernetes. For the production environment we recommend Helm or Hazelcast Operator because these methods provide the complete Hazelcast experience, including the following aspects:

* Install Hazelcast Management Center at the same time
* Configure `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe`
* Simple Hazelcast configuration
* Scale up/down Hazelcast cluster without data loss
* Rolling upgrades without data loss
* RBAC configuration

Helm::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
helm install hz-hazelcast hazelcast/hazelcast
----
--

Hazelcast Operator::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator/master/hazelcast-operator/operator-rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator/master/hazelcast-operator/hazelcast-rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator/master/hazelcast-operator/hazelcastcluster.crd.yaml
kubectl --validate=false apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator/master/hazelcast-operator/operator.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator/master/hazelcast-operator/hazelcast.yaml
----
--

Kubectl::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml

kubectl run hz-hazelcast-0 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-1 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-2 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"

kubectl create service clusterip hz-hazelcast --tcp=5701 -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl set selector --local -f - "role=hazelcast" -o yaml | kubectl create -f -
----
--

====

You can check that the Hazelcast cluster is up and running.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs hz-hazelcast-0
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.216.6.7]:5701 - 6d2100e0-8dcf-4e7c-ab40-8e98e23475e3 this
        Member [10.216.5.6]:5701 - 5ab4d554-fd7d-4929-8475-0ddf79a21076
        Member [10.216.8.6]:5701 - 7f7dd5f4-e732-4575-89d6-a6e823da38da
]
----

At this point you have a running Hazelcast cluster with 3 members, exposed with a service called `hz-hazelcast`.

== Configure Hazelcast client

To use Hazelcast client, first, you need to configure/install Hazelcast client dependency.

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
--
.pom.xml
[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>${hazelcast.version}</version>
</dependency>
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
var Client = require('hazelcast-client').Client;
----
--

====

Then, you can configure Hazelcast client in your application code to use `hz-hazelcast` (DNS of a service for Hazelcast cluster) as the member address.

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
--
[source, java]
----
ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
config.getNetworkConfig().addAddress("hz-hazelcast");

// Additionally configure connection retry timout
config.getConnectionStrategyConfig()
      .getConnectionRetryConfig()
      .setClusterConnectTimeoutMillis(Long.MAX_VALUE);
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, javascript]
----
var clientConfig = {
    network: {
        clusterMembers: [
            'hz-hazelcast'
        ]
    }
}
const client = await Client.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
----
--

====

With the configuration above, if you deploy your application to Kubernetes cluster, it should automatically connect to Hazelcast cluster.

== Deploy Hazelcast client application

To deploy your application to Kubernetes cluster, you need first to dockerize it.

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client java
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client nodejs
----
--

====

[NOTE]
====
If you use a remote Kubernetes cluster and you want to build your own Docker image then make sure that you also push your Docker image into the Docker registry.
====

[source, bash]
----
kubectl run hazelcast-client --image=hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client
----

After a moment, your application should run in Kubernetes. You can check its logs.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs hazelcast-client
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.216.6.7]:5701 - 6d2100e0-8dcf-4e7c-ab40-8e98e23475e3 this
        Member [10.216.5.6]:5701 - 5ab4d554-fd7d-4929-8475-0ddf79a21076
        Member [10.216.8.6]:5701 - 7f7dd5f4-e732-4575-89d6-a6e823da38da
]
...
Connection Successful!
Now the map named 'map' will be filled with random entries.
Current map size: 71754
Current map size: 71758
Current map size: 71782
Current map size: 71792
...
----

To remove the client application, execute the following command.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete pod hazelcast-client
----

== Tear down Hazelcast cluster

To delete Hazelcast cluster, run the following commands.

[tabs]
====

Helm::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
helm uninstall hazelcast
----
--

Hazelcast Operator::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator/master/hazelcast-operator/hazelcast.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator/master/hazelcast-operator/operator.yaml

kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-operator/master/hazelcast-operator/operator-rbac.yaml
----
--

Kubectl::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete service hz-hazelcast
kubectl delete pod hz-hazelcast-0 hz-hazelcast-1 hz-hazelcast-2
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml
