= Hazelcast for Kubernetes

This sample is a guideline on how to start and use Hazelcast cluster in Kubernetes.

include::{templates-url}/link-to-repo.adoc[]

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide, you will deploy Hazelcast cluster to Kubernetes and connect it to a Kubernetes application.

== Prerequisites

* Up and running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster (version 1.9 or higher)
* Kubernetes command line tool, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl]
* (optional) https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm CLI]

== Deploy Hazelcast cluster

There are different ways of deploying Hazelcast to Kubernetes. For the production environment we recommend Helm or Hazelcast Operator because these methods provide the complete Hazelcast experience, including the following aspects:

* Automated deployment including the Hazelcast Management Center tool
* Automated lifecycle operations (scaling, upgrades) to avoid data loss
* Role-based access control

Helm::

[source, bash]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
helm install hz-hazelcast hazelcast/hazelcast
----

Hazelcast Operator::

[source, bash]

----

Kubectl::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml

kubectl run hz-hazelcast-0 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"
kubectl run hz-hazelcast-1 --image=hazelcast/hazelcast:$HAZELCAST_VERSION -l "role=hazelcast"

kubectl create service clusterip hz-hazelcast --tcp=5701 -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl set selector --local -f - "role=hazelcast" -o yaml | kubectl create -f -

====

You can check that the Hazelcast cluster is up and running.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs hz-hazelcast-0
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.216.6.7]:5701 - 6d2100e0-8dcf-4e7c-ab40-8e98e23475e3 this
        Member [10.216.5.6]:5701 - 5ab4d554-fd7d-4929-8475-0ddf79a21076
        Member [10.216.8.6]:5701 - 7f7dd5f4-e732-4575-89d6-a6e823da38da
]
----

At this point you have started a Hazelcast cluster with 3 members. It is exposed with a service called `hz-hazelcast`.

== Configure Hazelcast client

Use Hazelcast client to connect to the running Hazelcast cluster from your applications.

To use Hazelcast client, add Hazelcast client dependency to your application.

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
--
.pom.xml
[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>${hazelcast.version}</version>
</dependency>
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, javascript]
----
const { Client } = require('hazelcast-client');
----
--

Python::
+
--
[source, python]
----
import hazelcast
----
--

====

Configure the Hazelcast client in your application to connect to the `hz-hazelcast` service.

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
--
[source, java]
----
ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();
config.getNetworkConfig().addAddress("hz-hazelcast");

// Additionally configure connection retry timout
config.getConnectionStrategyConfig()
      .getConnectionRetryConfig()
      .setClusterConnectTimeoutMillis(Long.MAX_VALUE);
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, javascript]
----
const clientConfig = {
    network: {
        clusterMembers: [
            'hz-hazelcast'
        ]
    }
};
const client = await Client.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
----
--

Python::
+
--
[source, python]
----
client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
    cluster_members=["hz-hazelcast"]
)
----
--

====

Your application is now configured to automatically connect to the Hazelcast cluster once it's deployed to Kubernetes.

== Deploy client application

To deploy your application to Kubernetes cluster, you need first to dockerize it.

[tabs]
====

Java::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client java
----
--

NodeJS::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client nodejs
----
--

Python::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client python
----
--

====

[NOTE]
====
If you use a remote Kubernetes cluster and you want to build your own Docker image then make sure that you also push your Docker image into the Docker registry.
====

[source, bash]
----
kubectl run hazelcast-client --image=hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client
----

After a moment, check application logs to see it running in Kubernetes.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs hazelcast-client
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.216.6.7]:5701 - 6d2100e0-8dcf-4e7c-ab40-8e98e23475e3 this
        Member [10.216.5.6]:5701 - 5ab4d554-fd7d-4929-8475-0ddf79a21076
        Member [10.216.8.6]:5701 - 7f7dd5f4-e732-4575-89d6-a6e823da38da
]

----

To remove the client application, execute the following command.

[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete pod hazelcast-client
----

== Tear down Hazelcast cluster

To delete Hazelcast cluster, run the following commands.
